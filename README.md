# pyopencl-test

A repository to keep track of a project on pattern matching using OpenCL

In this work we implement the most widely used algorithms for the exact [pattern-matching problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm) and compare them with the same algorithms but adopted for concurrent processing using the power of [OpenCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL). In addition, performance on different hardware configurations will be measured.

Here is the [link](https://github.com/JaakTree/pattern_matching) to main code sources for the current project.
